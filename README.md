# Predicting-Bank-Marketing-Campaign-Success-using-Logistic-Regression

Description: Built a logistic regression model to predict the likelihood of a bank marketing campaignâ€™s success using a mix of binary and continuous predictors, providing interpretable insights for strategic decision-making.

Loaded and preprocessed the bank marketing dataset, handled categorical variables, and removed irrelevant features for clean model input.

Developed a baseline model using campaign duration as a predictor, then expanded it to include multiple key attributes influencing outcomes.

Implemented and analyzed the model in statsmodels to interpret coefficients and assess variable significance.

Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix, training, and testing accuracy metrics, achieving 86.49% (train) and 86.94% (test) accuracy.

Derived actionable insights on the most impactful predictors of campaign success.

Tech Stack: Python, pandas, statsmodels, matplotlib, seaborn
